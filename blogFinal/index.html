            <p>
                Welcome to me blog! A little bit about myself is that I major in Media Design. I am currently on my last year
                which I am excited about. I enjoy watching Bobs Burgers in my free, eating and hanging with friends. I find Web Design
                interesting and I am mainly interested in UX/UI design. Coding is something I have done since college and throughout
                my time in this univeristy but it is always good to expand my knowledge as there is always something new to learn about coding.

            <h1>My Blog</h1>
            <p>
                In this blog I have my work throughout the trimester in this blog along with my group 
                projects work and development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I coded a simple three paged website with a home page, tutorials page, group work page. The layout of my 
                blog is simply the title, date and reflection accompanied by images placed in a column and grid like structure.
                When you hover over the images on my blog it glows around the boarder.  
            </p>
            <p>
                My website is responsive and the content stacks on top of each other when the screen size gets smaller. I
                wanted to use minimal colour  on my website so that viewers could focus more on the content and images.
