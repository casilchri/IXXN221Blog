            <h4>July 14th, 2020</h4>
            <p>
                For Tutorial One I searched for simple websites that were easy to recreate.
                I was looking for websites that had a simple layout that I could draw inspiration
                from when I create my own blog website. I also looked at the developer tool to get an idea
                of the structure of the website so I know how I would code it when I came to do it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I paid close attention to the layout of the websites, analysing the elements such as
                the footer, navigational bar, and placements of images and text. This gave me an idea of
                how a standard website is laid out and the important elements needed in one.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was one particular website I found which can be found here: <a href="https://vspicer.com/"
                    target="_blank">Victoria Spicer</a>

    <!-----------------------TUTORIAL TWO--------------------------->

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Tutorial Two</h2>
            <h4>July 16th, 2020</h4>
            <p>
                From the pervious Turtorial I got inspiration from this blog website about a Fashion Designers work,
                <a href="https://vspicer.com/" target="_blank">Victoria Spicer</a>. From there I began to build
                my website. For Tutorial Two I created a simple, one-page website. There is a header image in which
                the title and navigational bar are on top of. When you hover the mouse over the navigational bar it
                becomes underlined. When you scroll down I placed a gallery of images I took on my phone with a title
                and text accompanied by it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Continuing on from Tutorial One I began to construct my website. Drawing inspiration from the static
                and straightforward website I found, I used the elements such as the navigational bar on top of the
                header image and image placement into my website I began to construct. When starting my code, I made
                sure to practice in my CSS the Box Model when I was coding my website.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Tutorial Two I created a simple, one-page website. There is a header image in which the title and
                navigational bar are on top of. When you hover the mouse over the navigational bar it becomes
                underlined.
                When you scroll down I placed a gallery of images I took on my phone with a title and text accompanied
                by it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I got inspiration from the website. I didn't want to copy the layout of the website exactly but I copied
                the elements and structure. I made a header image with the navigational bar and text over it like the
                Victoria
                Spicer website. I also added photos and text when you scroll down further like the website as well.

    <!--------------------WEBSITE WIREFRAMES------------------------>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Website Wireframes</h2>
            <h4>July 21st, 2020</h4>
            <p>
                After doing those exercises of analysing an existing website and having a go at coding one that was
                similar to one I began to create my initial blog layout. Before I can code my website, I created a
                variety of website wireframes on Figma of potential website layouts. I made quick, rough drafts
                wireframes
                of what my blog could look like, keeping in mind from the first tutorial the key elements needed on a
                website.
                My initial idea was to have an image and text underneath, but I have to play around with the layout
                slightly as there will be more images and more text.

    <!----------------------TUTORIAL THREE-------------------------->

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Tutorial Three</h2>
            <h4>July 21st, 2020</h4>
            <p>
                For Tutorial Three I began to code my blog website. I made sure to start off simple as simplicity
                is key when coding. I wanted to get the basic elements done on my website to ensure I didn’t miss
                any of the main elements needed. I just wanted to not make it overly complicated and used the same
                website I was using to draw inspiration from into my blog design. I thought it would be easier as
                I already constructed a website in Tutorial Two but adapted it, so it was a blog.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why can Git be good for a group of designers?
            </p>
            <p>
                Git can be useful for designers as it is the most commonly used version control system. It tracks
                for you the changes a person makes in a file which means it records what has been done and you can
                go back and see the versions you’ve uploaded if needed to look back at previous work. This is good
                for a group of designers as it is a platform where the group all have access to the work. The work
                done would not be lost or tampered with. This makes collaboration easier as it allows changes to a
                file by multiple people making this good for a group of designers.

                For Tutorial Five I read the instructions in the ReadMe and completed the code challenge. I made
                the website so that is was responsive. When the screen is made smaller the sections stack on top
                of each other, adapting the website design to be suitable for phones, tablets, and smaller screens
                that just a laptop.

    <!----------------------BLOG DEVELOMENT------------------------->

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Blog Development</h2>
            <h4>September 24th, 2020</h4>
            <p>
                I made a change in layout and design for my website. My initial website was laid out so that
                there was text, title, and date at the top with all the images just placed below it. I still
                used that layout in my new blog design, but I made it more contained and sectioned off to the
                images. I also make the images placed in a gallery style to make use of my website space
                horizontally and I noticed that I had to scroll down a lot to the bottom of my website as I
                just stacked the images and text. By having my website laid out this way makes it more structured
                and cleaner visually.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made the discission to make three pages. A home page, a page of all my tutorials I did, and
                other work like progress, development, and other work included in this page. On my third page,
                I have my group work. Anything to do with my group work for the last assignment goes into that
                page. It just makes more sense of what I am communicating to myself and others.
