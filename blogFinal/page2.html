            <h2>Website Idea</h2>
            <p>
                As a group we went around each one of us shared ideas of potential websites we are interested in
                creating.
            </p>
            <p>
                We came up with these ideas and wrote them down. We all had in mind that we wanted to create a simple
                but
                elegant website. From there we made a group decision that we were going to make a website about indoor
                plants.
            </p>
            <p>
                We then further discussed a rough idea of what we wanted on the website that was relevant and achievable
                in
                the time we were given to create this website.
            </p>

            <h2>Mission Statement and Moodboard</h2>
            <p>
                Our group then created a Figma account so that we all had access to the work and information needed. One
                of
                our group members then wrote down our mission statement based on our points that we discussed to form a
                clear
                brief of what we were trying to accomplish.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we started our process of developing and planning our website by first creating a mood board so we
                as a
                group had a clear understanding of the vision of our plant website from the colour, layout, and images.

            <h2>User Persona</h2>
            <p>
                After creating the mission statement and piecing together the mood board we began to create intended
                user
                groups and user personas to narrow down our target audience. We needed to create 10 user personas so as
                a
                group we each had to make 2 different user personas. We aimed to make it detailed as possible and more
                specific of the type of groups our website is aimed for. From there we can build our website so that it
                fits
                this certain demographic.

                We then created a user flow diagram to know how many pages we needed for our plant website. We wanted to
                keep
                it simple and user friendly for the user to navigate through the website with ease. We only made 2
                pathways
                to navigate through the website and all the pages link with each other to get to each page.

                font, and
                other design elements that would be consistent throughout the whole website. I helped in finding the
                font
                for both the body text and header text. I also put some input into creating the logo design and the
                colour scheme.

    <!-----------------------BLOCK FRAMES--------------------------->

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Block Frames</h2>
            <p>
                Before we could even create our website wireframes we made block frames of our website. From doing
                our user flow diagram we established that we are going to be five pages we need to create for our
                website. To divide the workup we each designed a block frame for each concept. So we made three
                different iterations and we each picked a page we would design and when we moved on to the next
                concept idea we picked a different page to design so that eventually we all designed three different
                pages for three different concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way we decided out final block frames was that we all took turns going through each concept page
                and the person who created that particular block frame would talk about why they make it that way. We
                noticed that we all have similar ideas of how we would layout each page so it was pretty easy to pick
                our final block frame pages.

                For Tutorial One I searched for simple websites that was easy to recrated. I was looking for
                website that had a simple layout that I could draw inspiration from, when I create my website.
                I also looked at the developer tool to get an idea of the structure of the website so I know how
                I would code it when I came to doing it.

                little bits that make up our website were where we wanted. The images we used were filler
                images and we added in the text but they need to be worked on but we wanted to get a proper

                We all just used the website as a reference to know how to layout the website. There are slight

    <!-----------------USER TESTING AND FEEDBACK-------------------->

        <div class="content">
            <h2>User Feedback and Testing</h2>
            <p>
                I was in charge of creating the testing form and getting a good amount of questions for our users
                to answer once they have tested our website. These are the questions and responses we received from
                our user testers. The feedback and comments that were given were very helpful to further develop our
                website.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were also given comments and feedback when our group presented our website prototype in front of the
                rest of the class. We took into account all the feedback given and changed our website accordingly.

    <!-------------------MY WORK FOR THE GROUP---------------------->

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Introduction Page</h2>
            <p>
                After going through all that process we began to code our website. We set up Github so that all our
                group
                members have access to the code. I was in charge of coding/creating the introduction page. I completed
                the
                website structure and layout but I need to touch upon the code and small elements on the page. I have
                not
                made the website responsive but that is my next task to achieve and to fit the placement and sizing of
                the
                navigational bar, images, and text.

            <h2>Introduction Page Development</h2>
            <p>
                After getting feedback from my group about my introduction page I worked on getting the website
                responsive
                so that all the content such as the text and images stack up on top of each other when the screen
                decreases in size.
